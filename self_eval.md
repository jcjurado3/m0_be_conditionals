1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators? I believe I am confident with comparison operators.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators? Once I take a step back and think through then I can visualize it. I'm not as confident but will get there with practice.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements? This is taking me a bit to figure out the best way to code. I do need to think it out and helps writing down some notes before starting to code.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? Yes, I will practice the other challenges and keep practicing.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? No questions, just more practice.
